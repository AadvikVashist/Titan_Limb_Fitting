# Figures

1.**Transect Figure** (referenced as "transect fig")

- Shows how transects are selected based on angle relative to equator
- Demonstrates East/West facing transect selection
- Illustrates 30° North and 30° South sampling positions

2.**Quadrant Figure** (referenced as "quadrant fig")

- Shows original data compared to quadratic limb darkening law fits
- Demonstrates variations in fit accuracy
- Likely shows examples of both limb darkening and brightening cases

3.**Trust Mapping Figure** (mentioned in TODO)

- Would show mean/std analysis instead of std/mean
- Details not specified in text

4.**Transition period as a function of wavelength for three cubes**

- Shows the transition period as a function of wavelength for three different cubes
- One Cube is from prime (N Winter),
- One Cube is from N Spring (transitional period)
- One Cube is from N Summer  (post transition)

Purpose is to show evolution, and also the earlier transition in upper atmosphere when compared to lower atmosphere.

5.**SRTC++ Cube**

- Horizontally split - side byh side of one limb darkening, and one limb brightening. 

6.**Flowchart Figure** (referenced as "figure:flowchart")

- Outlines VIMS image processing algorithm
- Not detailed in current text but referenced

The text also suggests there should be figures showing:

- Example of limb darkening and brightening
- Transects themselves with quadratic fits
- Wavelength vs. u (limb darkening coefficient) plots stacked at different time periods

Would you like me to help draft any specific figure descriptions or LaTeX code for these figures?
