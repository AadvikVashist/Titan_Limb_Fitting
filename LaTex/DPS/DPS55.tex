We analyze the evolution of brightness profiles from Cassini Visual and
Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) spectral mapping cubes to gain
insights into the vertical structure of Titan's atmosphere. Using
low-phase angle observations from 2004-2017, we observe changes in the
shape of limb brightening profiles with regard to wavelength and time.
When densely sampled over a temporal period, these profiles can
independently track the development of different atmospheric layers on a
global level. We show that Titan's limb brightening depends on the
wavelength and varies as a function of time. Moreover, a comparison of
the brightness profiles over the northern and southern hemispheres
supports existing analyses of atmospheric asymmetry behavior. By using a
combination of both limb and asymmetry observations, we are able to
develop a greater understanding of the underlying seasonal dynamics of
Titan's haze, specifically its vertical structure.
